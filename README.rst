Tools for Common Murray Lab Protocols
=====================================

Code for common tasks in the Murray lab. Currently supported in 3.5. It may also work in Python 2.7 if you are careful to use only ASCII characters.

Install with the following (probably requires sudo): ``pip install git+git://github.com/sclamons/murraylab_tools.git@master``

To update, run (also with superuser privilege): ``pip install --upgrade --no-deps git+git://github.com/sclamons/murraylab_tools.git@master``

Currently includes the following subpackages:

echo: Echo Setup for TX-TL Experiments (and others)
=============================================

Code to produce Echo source plate setup instructions and picklists for one of the following cases:

* A TX-TL experiment with a TX-TL setup spreadsheet.
* A 2-dimensional dilution series, in TX-TL.
* Association of one or more substances on one or more source plates (not in TX-TL)

For details, see the "Echo Setup Usage Examples" ipython notebook under "examples".

biotek: Tidying and Analysis of Biotek Plate Reader Data
========================================================

Code for converting raw excel/CSV data from a Biotek plate reader into tidy format.

Also contains convenience functions for analysis of Biotek timecourse data:

* Background subtraction
* Endpoint averaging

For details, see the "Biotek Analysis Usage Examples" ipython notebook under "examples".
